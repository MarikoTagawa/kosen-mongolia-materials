# Kosen Mongolia Materials

*Available in: [日本語](./README.ja.md) | [Монгол хэл](./README.mn.md)*

This repository was created by **Mariko Tagawa**, a JICA Volunteer, to share educational materials used in computer science classes at three Mongolian Kosen schools during her assignment from 2023 to 2025:

- Mongol Koosen College of Technology (MKTK)  
- New Mongol College of Technology (NMCT)  
- Mongolian University of Science and Technology Kosen (MUST)

It includes curriculum materials, lecture slides, lab exercises, and test files used in actual classes. The goal is to enable shared use and collaborative development of teaching materials across all Mongolian Kosen institutions.

## Purpose

- Enable teachers to freely use and modify course materials for their own classes  
- Promote cross-Kosen collaboration to improve curriculum quality and consistency  
- Support self-learning for teachers through hands-on exercises and sample solutions  
- Share practical knowledge and best practices from Japanese IT engineers
