# Kosen Mongolia Materials

Welcome to the official repository of shared teaching materials for computer science and programming courses at Mongolian Kosens (Colleges of Technology).

This repository is maintained to support Kosen educators in Mongolia by providing organized, hands-on, and classroom-tested resources developed through real teaching practice.

---

## Purpose

- Share learning materials across Mongolian Kosen campuses
- Encourage collaboration among teachers and curriculum developers
- Support practice-based learning in computer science and programming
- Enable transparency and open access to resources for continuous improvement

## Courses Included

### [System Analysis & Design](./system-analysis-design/)
Materials for understanding the system development life cycle, modeling techniques, and designing practical software/system specifications.

### [Network Basics](./network-basics/)
Resources focused on foundational networking concepts, IP addressing, configuration labs, and hands-on simulations.

### [Programming Experiments](./programming-experiments/)
A project-based course using Python and Pygame where students create interactive programs like games or animations.

### [Fundamentals of Algorithms](./fundamentals-of-algorithms/)
Materials to help students learn the logic behind problem-solving, basic algorithm design, and Python implementations.
