## Course Purpose

The goal of this course is to make programming fun and practical by engaging students with creative coding exercises, games, and animations using Python and Pygame.

Students will:

- Practice programming by writing lots of code and completing fun exercises  
- Use **Python** and **Pygame** to make graphics, animations, and simple games  
- Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills  
- Turn ideas into real programs and games to share with others!
