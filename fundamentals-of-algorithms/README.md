# Fundamentals of Algorithms

This repository contains teaching materials for the **Fundamentals of Algorithms** course delivered at the **Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST) Kosen** in 2025.  
The course was designed and taught by **Mariko Tagawa** for **1st-grade students** in the **Computer Science department**.

All course materials are included in a single PowerPoint file.

## Course Overview

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the foundational concepts of algorithms and help them develop algorithmic thinking using a visual programming tool. Students build progressively more complex algorithms and apply them in creative tasks.

## Folder Structure

- `slides/` — PowerPoint slide `Fundamentals_Algorithms.pptx` — Complete slide deck containing all lesson materials, examples, and instructions.
This file is read-only. In order to modify the powerpoint file, please contact **Mariko Tagawa**.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the course, students must:

1. **Install Flowgorithm** — a visual tool for creating and running algorithms  
   [https://www.flowgorithm.org/](https://www.flowgorithm.org/)

2. **Create a SPOJ account** — to practice problems on an online judge platform  
   [https://www.spoj.com/](https://www.spoj.com/)

*Both tools and setup instructions are explained in the course PowerPoint.*
