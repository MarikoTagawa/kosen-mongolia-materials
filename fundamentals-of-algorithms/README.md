# Fundamentals of Algorithms

This repository contains teaching materials for the **Fundamentals of Algorithms** course delivered at the **Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST) Kosen**.  
The course was designed and taught by **Mariko Tagawa** for **1st-grade students** in the **Computer Science department**.

All course materials are included in a single PowerPoint file.

## Course Overview

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the foundational concepts of algorithms and help them develop algorithmic thinking using a visual programming tool. Students build progressively more complex algorithms and apply them in creative tasks.

### Weekly Topics and Tasks

**1. Introduction to Algorithms and Tools**  
- Learn the basics of algorithms  
- Install and explore [Flowgorithm](https://www.flowgorithm.org/)  
- Create the first algorithm in Flowgorithm  
- Explore and register on [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/), a platform for algorithm practice

**2. Building Basic Algorithms with Flowgorithm**  
- Sum of two numbers  
- Perimeter of a triangle  
- Cube of a number  
- Area of a rectangle  

**3. Customizing Functions in Algorithms**  
- Implement simple custom functions to enhance code modularity

**4. Exploring Numeric Operations Through Algorithms**  
- Extract digits from a number  
- Work with 2-digit and 3-digit numbers  
- Analyze individual digits

**5. Time and Date Conversions Using Algorithms**  
- Convert between minutes, seconds, and hours  
- Calculate total time in seconds  
- Convert between days and hours, years and months

**6. Using "If" Statements for Comparison**  
- Find maximum/minimum values among 2–4 numbers  
- Compare and make decisions using conditional logic

**7. Using Loops for Repeated Calculations**  
- Print text multiple times  
- Compute sums (e.g., 1 to N)  
- Calculate factorial (n!)  
- Use `for` and `while` loops to simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., weekly/monthly distance tracking)

**7–8. Final Project: Design Your Own Algorithm**  
- Students design and implement an original algorithm using Flowgorithm  
- Possible themes: quiz, game, calculator, or scenario-based tool

## Prerequisites

Before starting the course, students must:

1. **Install Flowgorithm** — a visual tool for creating and running algorithms  
   [https://www.flowgorithm.org/](https://www.flowgorithm.org/)

2. **Create a SPOJ account** — to practice problems on an online judge platform  
   [https://www.spoj.com/](https://www.spoj.com/)

*Both tools and setup instructions are explained in the course PowerPoint.*
