# Network Basics

This folder contains teaching and learning materials for the **Network Basics** course.

The course was designed and taught by **Mariko Tagawa** for 4th- and 5th-grade students in the Computer Science department of Mongol Kosen(MKTK). It is based on the Networking Basics course by the CISCO Networking Academy(https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics) , with additional original content developed to support classroom learning.

## Contents
- `slides/` — PowerPoint slide decks used in lectures.
- `packet_tracers/` — Cisco Packet Tracer simulation files and step-by-step instruction documents for hands-on exercises.
- `checktests/` — Quizzes, check tests, midterm, and final exams. Answers are included.

## Prerequisites
To conduct this course, both teachers and students need the following:

- A [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/) account (required to access course resources)
- Cisco **Packet Tracer** software (used for hands-on networking exercises)

Instructions for setting up these tools are provided in the PowerPoint deck:  
**`slides/01_NetworkBasics_2025_2P.pptx`**

## How to Use the Materials
