# Network Basics

This folder contains teaching and learning materials for the **Network Basics** course.

The course was designed and taught by **Mariko Tagawa** for 4th- and 5th-grade students in the Computer Science department of Mongol Kosen(MKTK). It is based on the Networking Basics course by the CISCO Networking Academy(https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics) , with additional original content developed to support classroom learning.

## Contents
- `slides/` — PowerPoint slide decks used in lectures.
- `packet_tracers/` — Cisco Packet Tracer simulation files and step-by-step instruction documents for hands-on exercises.
- `checktests/` — Quizzes, check tests, midterm, and final exams. Answers are included.

## Prerequisites
To conduct this course, both teachers and students need the following:

- A [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/) account (required to access course resources)
- Cisco **Packet Tracer** software (used for hands-on networking exercises)

Instructions for setting up these tools are provided in the PowerPoint deck:  
**`slides/01_NetworkBasics_2025_2P.pptx`**

## How to Use the Materials

### 1. Class Structure

Each class session is structured around a PowerPoint presentation found in the `slides/` folder. During the class:

- Conduct **2 to 3 quizzes** at appropriate points to assess understanding.
- At the end of the class, administer a **check test** to review the lesson.
- All quizzes and check tests are stored in the `checktests/` folder, with **answers provided**.

### 2. Hands-On Activities

In the second half of each class, conduct a hands-on networking exercise using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. Instructions for these activities are embedded in the PowerPoint slides. The corresponding simulation files are available in the `packet_tracers/` folder.

### 3. Google Forms
The Google Forms for quizzes, check tests, midterm test, and final term test are stored on my Google Drive. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HqLJR4dRIdOAd1Oy6QB_2XXDqhUHT9DU?usp=drive_link). If you need access to the Google Forms, please contact **Mariko Tagawa**.


## Exams

The **midterm and final exams** are located in the `checktests/` folder, along with the answer sheets.

## Course Goals
- Explain important concepts in network communication, network types, components, and connections.
- Explain the importance of standards and protocols in network communications.
- Explain how communication occurs on Ethernet networks.
- Explain the features of an IP address and IPv4 addresses are used in network communication.
- Explain features of IPv6 addressing.
- Explain how routers connect networks together.
- Use various tools to test and troubleshoot network connectivity.
- Configure an integrated wireless router and wireless client to connect securely to the internet.
